<BIG><B>Furiten</B></BIG>：(Japanese:FURI(discarded)-TENpai(ready to win))

It means you are already discarded one of winning tiles.
<BR>
e.g. Your winning tiles are <img src=@drawable/s_man1s><img src=@drawable/s_man4s><img src=@drawable/s_man7s>.
If you already discarded <img src=@drawable/s_man1s>, you can not call win for <img src=@drawable/s_man4s> and <img src=@drawable/s_man7s>.
And there is another case of Furiten, you can not call win until you draw your next tile if other player discarded one of winning tile and you missed it. 
<BR>
e.g. 
<BR>
 you may pass over for next player's <img src=@drawable/s_man1s> by the reason of aiming higher score.
You can not call Win for other player's <img src=@drawable/s_man1s><img src=@drawable/s_man4s><img src=@drawable/s_man7s> until your next Draw.
If you drawn one of those at next draw, you can call win by Self-Draw.
<BR>
If you have declared Riichi, regardless this setting, Furiten is checked depending <B>Furiten Riichi</B> of Yaku dialog.
<BR>

<BR>
which allows to handle irregular Local Win pattern.
<BR>
<BIG><B>Confirm Tenpai</B></BIG>：(Japanese:Tenpai=The hand is in status of ready to win)
<BR>
"No":Without checking Win-able pattern, do Discard selected(green framed) tile. It may cause Chombo of "NoTen Riich".
<BR>
<BR>
<BIG><B>SuspendOption</B></BIG>
