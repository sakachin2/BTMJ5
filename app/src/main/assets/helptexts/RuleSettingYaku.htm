Rules about <B>Yaku</B>(define pattern of winning hand and its value).
<BR>
 To check whether winning hand is complete or not, set "Do check" on topic <B>1-han constraint</B> of <B>Oper</B> Setting.
 Even if the check is set on, "Win" can be claimed for any hand by menu:<B>Win anyway</B> or <B>Win-A</B> button.
<BR>
After you called "Win", open <B>Win Claim</B> dialog by <B>Score</B> button. Then claim your hand's value by count of han and fu.
 (You may set ON to <B>Evaluate Point by APP</B> of <B>Oper</B> settings.)
<BR>
 "Win Claim" is sent to the other players, after all player responded <B>OK</B> or <B>NG</B>,
 <B>End-of-Hand</B> dialog opens on the dealer which displays winning tiles.
<BR>
If the dealer is Robot, the dialog opens on the next(counter clockwise) human player.
The dealer checks validity of the win call, then send the dialog to the other player.
After receiving "OK" from the other players, <B>Fix</B> the game to complete "End-of-Hand".
<BR>
If dealer found "Chombo"("Furiten", "Noten", "Noten Riichi", "Constraint by han" etc),
dealer can set <B>Invalid</B>(without penalty) or <B>Chombo</B>(with penalty).
In that case dealer can select "Gameover" or "Continue" with "DeadHand" of "Chombo" players.
DeadHand player continues to play just discarding drawn tile and can not do any call.

<BR>
<BR>
<BIG><B>Psuedo-Tenpai</BIG></B>
<BR>
By Japanese "Keishiki-Tenpai", Keishiki means formal, only in form or structure.
<BR>
In ExhaustiveDraw, if your-hand is not status of Tenpai with at least 1-han Yaku,
you have to pay penalty of Noten(Not Tenpai).
If dealer is Tenpai status, he can repeat next round as the dealer.
This paragraph loosen the standard of Tenpai.
<BR>
<B>Disable Psuedo-Tenpai</B>:
<BR>
You have to be able to call win by Ron(not by self-draw). It is not recognize as Tenpai for the case of
Furiten, Kataagari, <B>Fix Yaku</B> violation and 1/2-han constraint violation.
Missing winning tile after the last Discard is also checked as Furiten.
Empty winning tile remains is OK.
<BR>
<B>Furiten Riichi</B> is not a Tenpai because it can be win only by Self-Draw.
<BR>
If this setting is OFF, Psuedo-Tenpai is allowed as followings assuming you have self-drawn a winning tile.
<BR>
<B>0-han OK</B>:No Yaku is required by any of winning tile.
If OFF, at least 1-han except Dora is required by any one of winning tiles.
Accordingly menzen(All-In-Hand) is recognized as Psuedo-Tenpay by 1-han of Self-Draw.
Furiten is all OK.
<BR>
<B>Furiten Riichi</B> may impose Chombo penalty in some case, bit it is recognized as Psuedo-Tenpai.
<BR>
<B>When 2-han constraint</B>
<BR>
2-han constraint status occurs by <B>2-han constraint</B> setting bellow.
<BR>
<B>2-han required</B>:One of winning tiles have to construct at least 2-han.
<BR>
Riich+Self-Draw is 2-han by itself.
You can not call win under 2-han constraint status because Self-Draw is a accidental Yaku.
However it is recognized as Psuedo-Tenpai.

<BIG><B>Fix Yaku</BIG></B>
<BR>
Japanese style Mahjong requires your winning hand to have some Yaku(at least 1 han).
And there are rules of prohibit Ron for the case winning tiles are multiple.
There are some variation of "First only" rule, "Finally" is simple and fewer trouble case. It is generally adopted.
<BR>
Robot and human in PlayAlone mode follow the rule bellow, 
Human player in matching mode have to determine yourself to push "Win" button. 
When another player questions "violation of rule",
discuss then set on dialog "Chombo" or "Continue game with the player's abandonment of win". 
<BR>
<B>First only</B> :
<BR>
Winning tile constructing a Yaku have to be not selectable. That is all winning tile have to construct some Yaku.
<BR>
e.g. Kanchan(middle, e.g. win by 3 of 2-3-4), Penchan(one-side, e.g. win by 3 of 1-2-3)
, Ron by one of double pair of honor tiles are OK. Ryanmen(both side, win by 1 or 3 of 1-2-3 is NG
when winning tile is not part of the Yaku, the Yaku have to be already constructed in hand
OR hand together with Earth(meld called and opened) have to construct the Yaku,
but meld on Earth all have to be related to the Yaku. Not Related meld on Earth has to be after the Yaku fixed.
<BR>
e.g.) 1-han is conceiled in the hand.

 In the case of having 2 pairs of "Red" and "Green" in Hand, You can issue Ron for "Red" or "Green"

 For 3-Dragon-Small, Ron for Pair of White/Green/Red is OK unless you have other meld than triplet of W/G/R on Earth.

Special rule to gain points at ExhaustiveDraw to the player that
all Discards were 1, 9 and word tile, and any Discards were not called by other player.
The player's call is out of question.
<BR>
<B>No</B>:This rule is not applied.
<B>Win</B>:Regard as Win. No Noten penalty, remove Yakitori mark, stay dealer if dealer win.
<B>Drawn</B>:Regard as Drawn. Pay Noten penalty, leave Riichi beds, no additional CounterStick payment, rotate dealer if dealer is Noten.
<BR>
In both case Multiple Ron setting is applied. HeadBump means nearest to East wind position.
When Tobi occurred, Tobi prize player is  determined by the paying point of NagashiMangan, then Noten penalty.
Each is collected from the dealer or nearest position to the dealer.

<BIG><B>8 consecutive win</B></BIG>
<BR>
According to the following definitions, the dealers's win becomes Yakuman.
<BR>
However, in the operation settings, if "Evaluate Point" is OFF,
or if "Check 1-han constraint" is OFF, "8 consecutive win" will be disabled.
Local Yaku that are not standard winning pattern are not taken into consideration, so please set Yakuman in the "Win Claim" dialog.
Even if setting of "NagashiMangan" is "Win", "NagashiMangan" resets the number of consecutive win and it will not be a winning of "8 consecutive win".
<BR>
The number of consecutive wins for the player is displayed near the Dealer-Mark.
<BR>
<B>8 times as dealer</B>: When "Number of consecutive wins > Number of piled sticks", the number of wins includes the win as the immediately preceding non-dealer.
When "Number of consecutive wins < Number of piles sticks", the number of sticks include the count of Drawn-round.
This option makes the dealer's win as Yakuman of "8 consecutive win" when the smaller one is 7.
<BR>
<B>9 times as dealer</B>: When the Number of consecutive wins and the Number of piled sticks, whichever is smaller, is 8, the dealer's win will be considered as Yarkuman.
<BR>
<B>Start may be non-dealer</B>: When the number of consecutive wins is 7, the dealer's win is considered as Yakuman.
<BR>
<B>Dealer's win when 8 sticks</B>: Any number of stickes by Drawn-round can be included. This option is easy to judge.
<BR>
<B>Next is +8</B>: If this is OFF, all dealer's win is Yakuman until the non-dealer's win or Drawn-round.
If this is ON, the next 8 consecutive is the next Yakuman timing.
