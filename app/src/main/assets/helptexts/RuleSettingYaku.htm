Rules about <B>Yaku</B>(define pattern of winning hand and its value).
<BR>
 To check whether winning hand is complete or not, set "Do check" on topic <B>1-han constraint</B> of <B>Oper</B> Setting.
 Even if the check is set on, "Win" can be claimed for any hand by menu:<B>Win anyway</B> or <B>Win-A</B> button.

<BR>
If dealer found "Chombo"("Furiten", "Noten", "Noten Riichi", "Constraint by han" etc),
dealer can set <B>Invalid</B>(without penalty) or <B>Chombo</B>(with penalty).
In that case dealer can select "Gameover" or "Continue" with "DeadHand" of "Chombo" players.

<BIG><B>Show Win-A</B></BIG>：
This button is used to call win for irregular winning pattern of local rule.
Menu item<B>Win anyway</B> dose the same function but you may loose the opportunity.
<BR>
<BR>
<BIG><B>Psuedo-Tenpai</BIG></B>
<BR>
This (by Japanese "Keishiki-Tenpai") means the hand is in the status of waiting winning tile,
 but unable to call win by some reason.
At ExhaustiveDraw, if your-hand is not status of Tenpai(waiting winning tile) with Yaku, you have to pay penalty of NoTen(Not Tenpai).
 This agreement allows to assume some pattern of hands as Tenpai.
 <BR>
 <B>None all</B>:not allow any Psuedo-Tenpai. 
 <BR>
 <B>Empty OK</B>:Empty means all winning tiles are exhausted on river, earth and in your hands.
 <BR>
 <B>Furiten OK</B>:Allows winning tiles are Furiten state such as you discarded one of winning tile.
 <BR>
 <B>0-han OK</B>:regardless <B>1-han constraint</B> rule.
<BR>
<BIG><B>2-han constraint</BIG></B>
<BR>
Under 2-han constraint condition, <B>0-han OK</b>:no Yaku is required. <B>2-han possibility</b>:requires possibility of Yaku more than 2-han by a winning tile.
 But if Psuedo-Tenpai is "0-han OK", requires 1-han possibility.   
<BR>
<BIG><B>Fix Yaku</BIG></B>
<BR>
Japanese style Mahjong requires your winning hand to have some Yaku(at least 1 han).
And there are rules of prohibit Ron for the case winning tiles are multiple.
There are some variation of "First only" rule, "Finally" is simple and fewer trouble case. It is generally adopted.
<BR>
Robot and human in PlayAlone mode follow the rule bellow, 
Human player in matching mode hove to determine yourself to push "Win" button. 
When another player questions "violation of rule",
discuss then set on dialog "Chombo" or "Continue game with the player's abandonment of win". 
<BR>
--First only :
<BR>
Winning tile constructing a Yaku have to be not selectable. That is all winning tile have to construct any Yaku.
<BR>
e.g. Kanchan(middle, e.g. win by 3 of 2-3-4), Penchan(one-side, e.g. win by 3 of 1-2-3)
, Ron by one of double pair of honor tiles are OK. Ryanmen(both side, win by 1 or 3 of 1-2-3 is NG
when winning tile is not part of the Yaku, the Yaku have to be already constructed in hand
OR hand together with Earth(meld called and opened) have to construct the Yaku,
but meld on Earth all have to be related to the Yaku. Not Related meld on Earth has to be after the Yaku fixed.
<BR>
e.g.) "Straight" completed by Ron by Penchan tile is OK unless non-related meld is on Earth.
<BR>
 In the case of having 2 pairs of "Red" and "Green" in Hand, You can issue Ron for "Red" or "Green"
 if you did not yet called for non-honor tile.
<BR>
 For 3-Dragon-Small, Ron for Pair of White/Green/Red is OK unless you have other than triplet of W/G/R on Earth.
 If you have triplet in hand, you can call Ron by the concealed honor tile, and value of 3-Dragon-Small is added to your score.
 In the case of 3-Same-Seq:1-2-3 is constructed by Hand and Earth, you can call Chii for 4-5-6,
but it have to be after the Chii of 1-2-3 if there is.
Opened-Kan of Honor tile is not considered in Hand and "Fix-First" if first Earth, "Fix-Middle" if not first Earth.
<BR>
--Middle OK
<BR>
Same as "First only" except sequence on Earth is not a matter.
<BR>
--Finally
<BR>
It is OK if the winning tile constructs a Yaku regardless melds on Earth.
If there are multiple winning tile,  it is OK according to the following "Winning tile selection"
<BR>
--Winning tile selection
<BR>
Select setting for the case of Self-Draw.  
<BR>
Select setting for the case of "Finally" option is selected,
this is regardless of Self-Draw or Ron for other players discarded.
<BR>
It is OK even if all selection dose not construct the same Yaku but constructs any Yaku.
e.g. Winning tiles are 1-4 and 1 is for 3-Same-Seq and 4 is for Double-Run. 
<BR>
Note.
<BR>
Yakuman is out of "Fix Yaku" rule, concealed quad is on Earth but it is not regarded as called.
Count of meld on Earth is out of matter.
<BR>
This rule is used for checking 1/2-han constraint, and if OK value of Yaku is evaluated normally.
<BR>
<BIG><B>Riichi</BIG></B>(Reach)
<BR>
<B>OpenRiichi for Robot game</B>:Select from "Disable OpenRiichi", "Ignore Robot's discard" or "Pay usually(Robot pays the normal score with 1-han of "Open" added).
<BR>
As much as possible, robot will avoid to discard winning tile for OpenRiichi.
