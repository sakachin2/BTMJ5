<img src=@drawable/s_man5l><img src=@drawable/s_man4s><img src=@drawable/s_man6s>
which is Tenpai status but missing any Yaku.
When privious player discarded <img src=@drawable/s_man1s> you can or can't call Chii to make meld 
<img src=@drawable/s_man1l><img src=@drawable/s_man2s><img src=@drawable/s_man3s> to fix Yaku:Straight
and discard <img src=@drawable/s_man4s> which is not same as discarded tile but another side of the Meld.

which is Tenpai status with Yaku:Half Flush.
When privious player called Riichi discarding <img src=@drawable/s_man2s> you will want to avoid possibility of Riichi One-shot.
You can or can't call Chii making meld <img src=@drawable/s_man2l><img src=@drawable/s_man3s><img src=@drawable/s_man4s>
and discard the same tile <img src=@drawable/s_man2s> in you hand.
